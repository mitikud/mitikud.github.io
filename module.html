    <li>What is the difference between a method and function?</li>
<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</li>
<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</li>
<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</li>
<li> Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.</li>
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</li>
<li> What is a free variable in JavaScript?</li>
<li>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function</li>
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.</li>
<li> Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.</li>
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</li>
<li> Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.</li>
