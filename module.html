    <li>What is the difference between a method and function?</li>
    <span>A function is a block of code written to perform some specific set of tasks. We can define a function using the function keyword, followed by Name and optional parameters. Body of function is enclosed in Curly braces.
        <pre>Syntax: 

            function functionName(parameters) {
                // Content
            }
        </pre>
        A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition. Methods are functions stored as object properties. Object method can be accessed with the following syntax:
        <pre>
            Syntax:

                    object = {
                        methodName: function() {
                            // Content
                        }
                    };

                    object.methodName()

<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</li>
<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</li>
<span>
    In a method, this refers to the owner object.
</span>
<li> What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</li>
<span>This refers to the instance object</span>
<li> Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing keyword 'this'.</li>
When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</li><span>This refers to the object x</span>

<li> What is a free variable in JavaScript?</li><span>A free variables are variables used in the inner function and they are lacal variable or parameters to the enclosing function</span>
<li>Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a function</li>
that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are equal.
<span>
    <pre>
    var obj = {
        name:"fred",
        major:"music",
        minOrSquare : function(x,y) {
            if(x === y){
                return x*y;
            }
            return Math.min(x,y)
        }

<li> Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor function.</li>
Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</li>
<span>
    <span>
    <pre>
function Employee(first, salary, position) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.salary = salary;
    this.position = position;
    this.getFullDetail = function () {
        return this.firstName + " " + "works in the position " + this.position + " and earns $" + this.salary;
    };
 
  };

<li> Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
arguments.</li>
<span>
    <pre>
        var f = function (a,b,...more){
            var res = a * b;
          if(more.length > 0){
